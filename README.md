Me learning K3s ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. for Redis, check [redis-deployment](redis-deployment/)
2. for Postgres, check [postgres-deployment](postgres-deployment/)
3. for MySQL, check [mysql-deployment](mysql-deployment/)

## Note:
I have got the base from [Pi4Cluster](https://rpi4cluster.com/k3s/k3s-redis/?utm_source=github&utm_id=zaher/k3s-recipe) guide about deploying redis to k3s, and then used it to build my own recipe for both Postgres and MySQL.

So thanks to [Vladimir Strycek](https://rpi4cluster.com/?utm_source=github&utm_id=zaher/k3s-recipe) and his valuable site.
